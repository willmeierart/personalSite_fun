        <br>Will Meier is an artist / writer / wannabe futurist based in Denver CO, where he builds exhibits at Denver Art Museum, handles art for Robischon Gallery, and writes about art in the online publication One Good Eye. As of recently, he has begun shifting trajectories into a career in programming.
        <br><br> After receiving his BFA double-major in Painting and Creative Writing from Kansas City Art Institute in 2013, he was awarded an art-writing studio residency through the KC nonprofit Charlotte Street Foundation. During this time he began art-handling
        and exhibitions work for museums and art galleries. Following his residency, he left Kansas City by camping across the country on a motorcycle for a couple months, doing some seasonal work in rural California, and somehow winding up back in Denver.
        <br><br> Will’s artwork takes on many forms, from light sculpture, to oil paintings on glass, to full-scale mini-architectural ‘forts’, etc. His work has been shown in galleries, belongs to several private collections, and has been featured in online publications,
        most recently in the Boulder-based Patient Sounds’ WINDOW. His writings have been featured in print and online in Kansas City, Chicago, and Denver.
        <br><br> Over the past year or so, Will’s longstanding interest in technology has taken the forefront in his creative practice. With his sights set on involvement with The Future Of The Museum Experience, code is now his primary craft. He is launching into this new role with acceptance into the Galvanize Full-Stack Web Development Immersive bootcamp program in April 2017.
